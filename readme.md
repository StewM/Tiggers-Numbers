# Tigger's Numbers

Tigger's numbers is a fun joke thought up by John Michonski and the other great people over at Video Game Choo Choo.

I decided to follow through the joke with a twitter account and discord bot, and have been fleshing it out for fun. Tigger will post his numbers every day at noon UTC.

You can follow the twitter account [here](https://twitter.com/TiggersNumbers). You can invite the bot to your server [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=364587528554020864&scope=bot).

Once you've added the bot to your server you can use the following commands:
- `@Tigger subscribe` will subscribe the channel you send it in if you're an admin
- `@Tigger unsubscribe` will unsubscribe the channel you send it in if you're an admin
- `@Tigger subscriptions` will list all the channels on your server that are subscribed
